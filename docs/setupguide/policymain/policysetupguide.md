# Policy Setup for Control Tracking
With Smart DevOps, you are not just pushing changes blindly. Every step is tracked, giving you full visibility into what is happening and when. This means youâ€™ll always know:

Who is working on what - You can see exactly when an issue was assigned and to whom.

What changes are being made - Every edit, create, delete, or deployment is recorded.
