# What is Smart DevOps?

Smart DevOps is a comprehensive, end-to-end solution designed specifically for the Blue Yonder (BY) WMS environment, where development and configuration are closely intertwined.

 In such a setup, even minor changes can significantly impact production, making it critical to maintain full visibility, accuracy, and control over every modification.
With Smart DevOps, all changes whether in code, configurations, or data are tracked, managed, and seamlessly transformed into deployable rollouts.

The Rollout Application serves as a central hub for listing, managing, building, and downloading rollouts. It supports both standard BY methodology and REFS rollouts. It provides complete visibility of changes, links them to specific change IDs, and ensures that deployments are structured and ready for production with minimal effort.

Smart DevOps fits seamlessly into a modern development ecosystem by integrating with industry-standard issue management platforms like JIRA for tracking change requests, bug fixes, and feature development. For version control, it supports tools like GIT (and compatible platforms such as Bitbucket) to manage code versions, maintain history, and collaborate effectively across teams. 

By combining change tracking, rollout management, issue tracking, and version control into a unified workflow, Smart DevOps offers one comprehensive toolset and methodology ensuring consistency, reliability, and efficiency throughout the BY WMS development lifecycle.
