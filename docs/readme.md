# SmartDev Ops

## Introduction

Congratulations on choosing **Smart Dev ops** - your all-in-one solution. 

This user guide is designed to help you with our powerful and intuitive software, guiding you through its features and functionality.

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced user, this comprehensive guide will walk you through the essential operations of Smart Moca Client latest version i.e. `{{ mocaMMR }}`,  from installation to mastering advanced features. 

## Purpose

Smart Devops was initially developed to improve upon RedPrairie’s WinMSQL. At the time, WinMSQL could not open multiple tabs for connections and did not allow the user to cancel execution, which could force the user to close the window by force and start another, a time-consuming and unnecessary process. 

Moreover, [Smart IS International](https://www.smart-is.com/) realized that our developers need to be empowered with a development tool that can overcome the shortcomings of the Blue Yonder application, while respecting the challenges that each client’s infrastructure landscape may present. We worked to create one tool that can directly access all Blue Yonder data and render it to your needs. 

Smart Moca Client can perform several tasks in the most efficient manner possible and is more efficient and user-friendly.
