# Smart DevOps

## Background

In BY WMS, development and configuration have a remarkably close relationship. Managing all the changes that can impact production is a daunting task, requiring deep knowledge of the inner workings of the software and its data model. **Smart ISâ€™ DevOps solution** tracks all changes in the BY environment.

---

## Features

- Track all changes in the BY-WMS environment.
- Hide the complexity of the BY data model from the developer or the functional user making the change.
- Repeatable process to reduce manual export errors from a user.
- End-to-end management: from making the change to managing the data extraction, committing to a repository, and building a rollout.
- Provide visibility of the changes against the change identifier.

- The client is not re-inventing the wheel, nor needing to develop a new methodology.

- **Rollout Builder** builds the rollout in standard BY methodology for easy deployment.
- Build a rollout for a given change identifier or multiple ones based on a **Sprint schedule**.
