# Overview 
This document serves as the user manual for the Rollout Application.

The Rollout Application connects Azure, used for issue management, with Git, the version control system. It introduces a rollout feature that allows users to generate deployment packages based on Azure issue IDs. These rollout packages can be downloaded as zip or tar files. By automating the creation and management of rollouts, the application greatly improves deployment efficiency. It helps save substantial time by eliminating the need to manually track and package affected files.
