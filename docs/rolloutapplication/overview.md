# Overview 

The Rollout Application supports connections to popular issue management tools like Azure DevOps, GitHub, and Bitbucket, as well as version control systems such as Git.

It offers a rollout feature that enables users to generate deployment packages directly from issue IDs in the connected issue management tool.

The application supports downloading rollout packages in ZIP or TAR formats, automating the process of identifying and packaging affected files. This significantly boosts deployment efficiency by eliminating the need for manual tracking.

In addition to generating packages, the Rollout Application allows you to:
- Connect and configure multiple issue management and version control systems.
- Perform rollout management operations such as create, delete, recreate, and more.
- Configure system settings to tailor the deployment process.
- Maintain detailed logs for tracking all rollout activities and changes.

By centralizing these capabilities, the Rollout Application streamlines release processes, ensures accuracy, and saves substantial time in managing deployments
